# Road-Accident-Dashboard
I'm thrilled to discuss the recent Excel project I've embarked on for educational purposes. This undertaking serves as a tangible application of the concepts and skills I've gained during my studies, offering a practical, hands-on experience in both data analysis and spreadsheet management.

The project, named "Road Accident Dashboard," aims to assist stakeholders in comprehending the overall number of casualties occurring post fatality, the corresponding percentages of these casualties, the total accident severity, casualties categorized by the type of vehicle, monthly trends, a comparison with casualties from the current and previous years, road types, road surface-related casualties, and casualties categorized by area and day/night incidents.

Project Requirements:
Primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Total casualties occurring after fatalities.
- Overall casualties and their respective percentages concerning accident severity, highlighting the maximum casualties based on vehicle type.

Secondary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Total casualties categorized by vehicle type.
- Monthly trend analysis comparing casualties between the current and previous years.
- Identification of the maximum casualties based on road type.
- Distribution analysis of total casualties based on road surface.
- Examination of the correlation between casualties concerning area/location and day/night incidents.
  
All answers to the provided questions are accessible within the dashboard.
